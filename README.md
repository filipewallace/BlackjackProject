# Blackjack Application

### Description
This program is a way to play the game BlackJack. Only one player (you), against the dealer (my genius code). The player and dealer are given cards and the player can decide to either hit (get another card) or stay (no more cards). Whoever gets the closest to 21 without going above it wins. This program is definitely not rigged so the house always wins.
### Technologies Used
This program is written in Java code using Eclipse IDE. 
### Lessons Learned
Getting more familiar with a large number of classes being used and interacting with each other and also learning how to play BlackJack.
